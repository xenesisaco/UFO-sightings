# UFO-sightings

## Overview of Project

To produce a dynamic webpage that is able to receive user inputs and perform an auto filter on already-provided data regarding UFOs.

## Results

 The main page is as shown below. If a refresh page is needed, the user may click at the top, as seen in the yellow square.

To find a specific UFO instance, the user must input a date, city, state, country and/or shape into the filters on the left hand side of the webpage. As the user inputs, the data will begin to filter automatically.

## Summary

A couple of drawbacks from this website can be observed. 

1.	The user must know a specific instance of a UFO sighting/event and be able to input the instance correctly. If someone was curious regarding other instances, they would need to know at least a city/state if available. The user would not know what is available (in terms of data) until she/he has already started to write the filter.

- Resolution: A method to fix this issue would be to have a drop-down menu for each filter, and as the input for the filter is placed, the options for the other drop-down menus disappear.  

2.	In order to clear the filters, the user would need to refresh the page every time. Instead, creating a ‘clear’ button that automatically clears the filter inputs would be desirable.
